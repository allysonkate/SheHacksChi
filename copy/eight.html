<h2>Tumblr Templates:</h2>
You’ve probably noticed some code in Tumblr themes wrapped in curly braces, or “mustaches”, like this: <code>{Title}</code>.
<br><br>
Code that is wrapped in these mustaches is a placeholder for information you’ve already stored in your Tumblr account settings. Try replacing your manually typed title name with <code>{Title}</code> and your manually typed description with <code>{Description}</code> and notice how it shows up in the preview.
